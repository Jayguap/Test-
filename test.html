Welcome to my first website. 
</h1>
<P>
    I am still learning how to code, to create. <br>
    I am really hoping to make something really cool and nice <br>
    to get peoples attention. <br> I really enjoy coding just learning coding makes me feel like sometimes its not worth it.
    <br> I wont stop though i have no choice but to make it.
</P>

<h2> 
    Coding isn't that hard.
</h2>
<p> 
The reason people think its so hard is because <br> 
it is problem solving skills you would have to acquire over time. <br>
Atleast that's my theory. Coding is hard if you let it be hard, if you take the time to actual wanna learn it and enjoy learning it. <br>
It should come to you easy. But it took awhile for me to code I basically had to force my self to learn it not because i didn't wanna learn how to code <br>
but because how i was learning it was wrong atleast for me.
